## Bread Express
#### 67-272 Phase 5 - Final Project

Alex and Mark are continuing their entrepreneurial ways by starting up the A & M Bread Express Company, an online bakery that delivers fresh baked goods just like their mom used to (and still does) make. This online application helps customers order baked goods and employees get those goods baked and shipped on time.

The goal of this semester long project was to design, develop, and deploy a full rails application from the ground up.
This is my first web application project that summarizes everything I've learned this past semester.


----------
To set this up, clone this repository, run the `bundle install` command to ensure you have all the needed gems and then create the database with `rake db:migrate`.  If you want to populate the system with fictitious data, you can run the `rake db:populate` command.  The populate script will create 120 customers, over 600 orders, and a menu of 8 items.

Some sample accounts are named `mark`, `alex`, `baker`, and `shipper`. All account passwords are `secret`, but feel free to create your own!
